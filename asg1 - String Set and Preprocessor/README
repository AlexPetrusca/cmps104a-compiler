PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This program is compiled by running the "make" command-line instruction
in the working directory of this program, which contains a file named
"Makefile". The executable created should be named "oc". When oc is run
and passed a file with the suffix ".oc" as an arguement, it will create
a new file with the same name but with the suffix ".str" in the current
directory. The accompanying ".str" will contain the dump data of the CPP
preprocessed .oc file after it has been tokenized and inserted into the 
unordered set hashmap of the string_set ADT.
