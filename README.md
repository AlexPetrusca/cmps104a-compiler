# cmps104a-compiler

An introduction to the
basic techniques used in compiler design. Topics include compiler structure, symbol
tables, regular expressions and languages, finite automata, lexical analysis, contextfree
languages, LL(1), recursive descent, LALR(1), and LR(1) parsing ; and
attribute grammars as a model of syntax-directed translation. Students use compiler
building tools to construct a working compiler.
